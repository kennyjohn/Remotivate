On the journey to reaching success, I have come across some very inspirational people that have affected the way I approach every day. 
Some days are harder than others, but Remotivate is intended to motivate you even when you encounter these difficult days. The goal of the application
is to quickly remind yourself of the things that drive you every day. Whether it's adding a picture of your family, 
or a video of some place to visit on your next vacation, you can reflect on why those things drive you. 
Whenever you feel unmotivated, you can visit those entries and even redefine what they mean to you over time. 
Motivation fluctuates, so I wanted to build this application to facilitate a boost of motivation in usersâ€™ everyday lives.

### Known Issues
> **Note:** This list includes issues that I have come across while testing the
> usability of the application. I am still trying to figure out how to solve these issues as I learn more.

- Failed to load resource: **net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT** in the console: I have read on some articles that this is caused by Adblock when there are video entries on the dashboard. From what I understand, the Adblock is intercepting (and blocking) the ads that are supposed to be shown in the videos, so an error is thrown to denote this action. 

### Future Plans
- Only allow 9-12 entries per page to reduce page load time.
- Migrating from Firebase to MongoDB to support scalability.
- Support an Upload Image button, allow image files instead of just links.
- Potentially add some 3rd party API integration.

if you have any suggestions on how I can improve as a developer, or have feedback for the application. Take care!
