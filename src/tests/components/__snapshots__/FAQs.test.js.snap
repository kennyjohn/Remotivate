      Why are my images not showing up properly?
    </p>
    <p>
      Please make sure that the image URL that you provide is a direct link to the image. One way that I have found you can test whether it is a direct link or not is by entering the URL into the search bar. If a valid image shows up (e.g. does not direct you to an article), it is a direct link.

      Why are my videos not showing up properly?
    </p>
    <p>
      Please make sure that the Youtube video URL you provide follows this format: https://www.youtube.com/
      <strong>
        watch?v=rQZhQdg46do
      </strong>
      . It is also worth mentioning that at the moment, only Youtube video URLs are accepted.

      When I look at the Chrome console, I see error messages. What do these messages mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      This probably means you have Adblock enabled. When the videos are displayed, they are making requests to Youtube and Adblock is intercepting those requests.
